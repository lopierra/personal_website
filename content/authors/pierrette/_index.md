I'm a communicator and project manager with a passion for science. I like asking questions, but having been away from the bench for so long, I haven't been in a position to investigate answers. Recently, though, I decided that if I can't do my own experiments, I could at least get more hands-on with the data. I started teaching myself a little R and SQL in 2017, then fell down the rabbit hole of tidy data, data viz, reproducible research, and open science.  Since then, I've been working on expanding my skill set and job duties to incorporate these newfound interests. 

I'm currently a Data & Collaborations Project Manager in Brian Druker's leukemia research lab at the Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Institute. My very diverse job duties include managing our lab's collaborations with pharma/biotech partners; leading our lab's journey towards reproducible research using open data-science tools; incorporating automation and reproducibility into our data analyses and reports; and helping my colleagues (and myself!) learn to use these tools.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of attending the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://csvconf.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;csv,conf,v5&lt;/a&gt; virtual conference last week. It&amp;rsquo;s named after the CSV data format, but it&amp;rsquo;s a unique mix of speakers and topics at the intersection of data science, journalism, tech, advocacy, open source, academic research, and government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended in person last year and wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure it would be relevant to our interests as biomedical researchers, but I came away inspired about open science and reproducibility. It was also refreshing to interact with so many interesting people from outside our usual bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s conference was scheduled to take place in Washington, DC, but as a small upside of the pandemic, it was converted to a virtual conference. They had solid attendance, the Crowdcast platform worked well, and the organizers did a phenomenal job of keeping things running smoothly and on time while making everyone feel welcome. Between the chat/question windows, Slack, and live-tweeting, I&amp;rsquo;m amazed at the multitasking involved in participating in a virtual conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a quick rundown of talks and other resources that I found most relevant to my work. There was so much more content that I didn&amp;rsquo;t cover here, so if you have data-related side passions, I encourage you to explore the full schedule!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are still some good tutorials and other materials on best practices and tools for reproducible research on the workshop&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nlm-repro.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free virtual Frictionless Data workshop on May 20 â€“ sign up 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.okfn.org/2020/04/28/join-the-frictionless-data-workshop-20-may/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

We introduce the existing conventions for research compendia and suggest how to utilise their shared properties in a structured reading process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;How open science helps researchers succeed&lt;/a&gt; (article) â€“ Practicing &amp;ldquo;open science&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t just about altruism â€“ it can help your career, too&lt;/li&gt;

If you&amp;rsquo;ve been working in R but are ashamed to share your code with others â€“ (a) don&amp;rsquo;t be! Everyone feels the same way; but (b) the tips in this talk will help you clean things up, both for others and your future self. This talk is based on this excellent
